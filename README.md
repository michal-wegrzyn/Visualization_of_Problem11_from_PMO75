# Visualization of Problem 11 from Stage 1 of 75. Polish Math Olympiad

## Problem

An equilateral triangle-shaped board is covered with $3n$ triangular tiles on the edges and $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ hexagonal tiles inside, as in the visualization. Find all n for which a closed polyline can be created from red edges by rotating the hexagons.

## Functionalities

-   to rotate the hexagon, click on it
-   n can be changed in the top bar
-   the top bar contains information whether a closed polyline is created
